# Coding Temple Mini-Project: Library Management System 2

This is a project completed for my Coding Temple bootcamp, it's an upgraded version of my previous library management system
project using SQL to store the data.

## Getting Started

Download all the files and run the create_tables.py, then you can use the main.py for the main program. You're gonna need to
have the "library" database set up in SQL, and replace my password with yours. If you're my instructor, this should either already
be done, or be easy.

### Prerequisites

Must have SQL installed with the "library" database created

### Installing

Just open the files in VS Code probably

## Built With

Python on VS Code and SQL with VS Code and MySQL Workbench

## Authors

With some assistance from Allan Ahmed, Katelyn Mehner, Dylan Katina, and ChatGPT

### Note
I used a README template but I'm guessing this is still inadequate because I suck at writing. Dropped out of college because I couldn't write. Sorry if this README isn't on par.
