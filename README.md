# Coding Temple Mini-Project: Library Management System

This is a project completed for my Coding Temple bootcamp, it's a relatively simple program for managing a library system, with functions for adding books, checking out books, returning books, storing user info, storing author info, and whatever.

## Getting Started

Put each file in the same folder and run main.py. I could've just put everything in menu.py into main.py but whatever.

### Prerequisites

You must use a Python IDE to run this, I like VS Code for editing but IDLE is nice for running.

### Installing

Just download the files into a folder.

## Built With

Python on VS Code

## Authors

Jared Wilson (it's for my grade)
Allan Ahmed (helped with a lot of it)
Daniel Erazo (helped with some finishing touches)
I might be forgetting someone, sorry. If you helped and I don't remember, know I still appreciated it.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks, Allan and Daniel.

### Note
I used a README template but I'm guessing this is still inadequate because I suck at writing. Dropped out of college because I couldn't write. Sorry if this README isn't on par.
